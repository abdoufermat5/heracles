# Dovecot LDAP Authentication Configuration for Heracles Demo
# =============================================================================
# Direct LDAP simple bind — Dovecot authenticates users by binding to
# OpenLDAP with the user's own DN and password (no service account needed
# for authentication, only for the DN lookup query).
#
# Template variables: @LDAP_HOST@, @LDAP_PORT@, @LDAP_BIND_DN@,
#                     @LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD@, @MAIL_LDAP_SEARCH_BASE@
# =============================================================================

# LDAP server connection
hosts = @LDAP_HOST@:@LDAP_PORT@
ldap_version = 3

# TLS for the LDAP connection itself (disabled for demo — plain LDAP on LAN)
tls = no

# --- DN lookup phase ---
# We need a service account to search for the user's DN before binding.
# Searches the full tree so users inside departments are also found.
# e.g. uid=<user>,ou=people,dc=heracles,dc=local
#   or uid=<user>,ou=people,ou=Engineering,dc=heracles,dc=local
dn = @LDAP_BIND_DN@
dnpass = @LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD@

# --- Authentication method ---
# auth_bind = yes  →  Dovecot does an LDAP bind with the user's own DN + password.
# This is the simplest and most secure approach: passwords are never read from LDAP,
# they are verified server-side by OpenLDAP itself.
auth_bind = yes

# --- User lookup ---
base = @MAIL_LDAP_SEARCH_BASE@

# Only authenticate users that have the hrcMailAccount objectClass active.
# This means the mail plugin MUST be activated on the user in Heracles before
# they can log in to IMAP/SMTP.
pass_filter = (&(objectClass=hrcMailAccount)(uid=%n))

# Attributes to fetch (used by Dovecot for user info)
pass_attrs = \
  uid=user, \
  mail=mail

# User filter (for userdb lookups — reads quota from LDAP)
user_filter = (&(objectClass=hrcMailAccount)(uid=%n))
user_attrs = \
  uid=user, \
  =home=@VMAIL_HOME@/@DOMAIN@/%n, \
  =uid=@VMAIL_UID@, \
  =gid=@VMAIL_GID@, \
  hrcMailQuota=quota_rule=*:storage=%$M

# Iterate filter (for doveadm user listing)
iterate_filter = (objectClass=hrcMailAccount)
